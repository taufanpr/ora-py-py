# Basic classification: Classify images of clothing

'''
This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. It's okay if you don't understand all the details; this is a fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program with the details explained as you go.

This guide uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

#Import the Fashion MNIST dataset
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

'''
Loading the dataset returns four NumPy arrays:

The train_images and train_labels arrays are the training setâ€”the data the model uses to learn.
The model is tested against the test set, the test_images, and test_labels arrays.
The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the class of clothing the image represents:

Label	Class
0	T-shirt/top
1	Trouser
2	Pullover
3	Dress
4	Coat
5	Sandal
6	Shirt
7	Sneaker
8	Bag
9	Ankle boot
'''

# Each image is mapped to a single label. Since the class names are not included with the dataset, store them here to use later when plotting the images:

class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat',
               'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']



## Explore the data
'''
Let's explore the format of the dataset before training the model. The following shows there are 60,000 images in the training set, with each image represented as 28 x 28 pixels:
'''

train_images.shape
'''
Hasil:
(60000, 28, 28)
'''

#Likewise, there are 60,000 labels in the training set:
len(train_labels)
'''
Hasil:
60000
'''

#Each label is an integer between 0 and 9:
train_labels
'''
Hasil:
array([9, 0, 0, ..., 3, 0, 5], dtype=uint8)
'''

#There are 10,000 images in the test set. Again, each image is represented as 28 x 28 pixels:
test_images.shape
'''
Hasil:
(10000, 28, 28)
'''

#And the test set contains 10,000 images labels:
len(test_labels)
'''
Hasil:
10000
'''


## Preprocess the data
'''The data must be preprocessed before training the network. If you inspect the first image in the training set, you will see that the pixel values fall in the range of 0 to 255:
'''
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(train_images[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()
'''

#Scale these values to a range of 0 to 1 before feeding them to the neural network model. To do so, divide the values by 255. It's important that the training set and the testing set be preprocessed in the same way:
train_images = train_images / 255.0

test_images = test_images / 255.0


#To verify that the data is in the correct format and that you're ready to build and train the network, let's display the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image.
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i]])
plt.show()
